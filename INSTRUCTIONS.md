I plan on using one set of these on each stool to hold the seat and footrest down https://www.leevalley.com/en-us/shop/hardware/fasteners/connectors/76549-striplox-90-panel-connectors


You can access and edit the design with Fusion 360 here  https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue2a32b38/g/shares/SH56a43QTfd62c1cd9684d0ab47247fa49be. 

Make sure that Fusion actually cuts the dogbones in the bottom of the seat.
